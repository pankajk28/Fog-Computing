# Fog-Computing
Fog Computing is a paradigm that extends Cloud computing and services to the edge of the network. Similar to Cloud, Fog provides data, compute, storage, and application services to end-users. As these two technologies start getting deployed on a larger scale, the need to decrease the data transferred between the actual devices and the cloud systems have come into picture. Fog computing uses the concept of collecting all the data from similar devices in the same unit and then sending it to a local computing device which can process the large amounts of data. After the processing is complete, only the required data is sent to the cloud for further use. This helps us avoid a lot of work and also saves a lot of bandwidth needed to send all the unprocessed data to the Cloud Computing today which is based on various smart devices, computers, networks of computers, and high performance computers who benefits of various middleware to efficiently provide fastest, dependable and secure services
